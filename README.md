package management hell !  UNMET peer dependencies 

This pkg only works with this verion or greater please update zoom-bot!

open source with 10,000 packages, 100's of contributors and multiple builds !!

I've got it working locally, but trying to put it live on Google Cloud is META nightmare

theres local builds getting pushed into cloud builds and the local builds running in the cloud wonder 
where the scripts are for the local builds (which are actually being used to deploy to the cloud and kick off the cloud build )

FAWK!
